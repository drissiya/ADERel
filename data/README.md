## Datasets
We conducted experiments on two datasets:
- TAC 2017 dataset: includes 200 drug labels in XML format separated into 101 labels for the training set and 99 ones for the test set. After clone this repository, download the training set from [here](https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/tac2017adversereactions/), unzip the file and put the xml files to the data/tac/train folder. After getting received the gold set by the organizers, put the xml files to the data/tac/gold folder. The data/tac/TR and data/tac/TE folders contain the sentence boundary outcomes for training and test sets, respectively, obtained from [GENIA Sentence Splitter](http://www.nactem.ac.uk/y-matsu/geniass/).
- n2c2 2018 dataset: contains 505 discharge summaries in brat format separated into 303 for training set and 202 for testing set. You must sign the agreements from [here](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/) to request access to this dataset as well as the official script for evaluation. After clone this repository, place the train, test and guess brat files to the data/n2c2/train, data/n2c2/gold and data/ADR/N2C2/guess folders, respectively.
